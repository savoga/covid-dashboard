### Introduction

This project is part of a university course named Information Vizualization attended at Télécom Paris. The dashboard is live at the following link: https://covid-hospital-tracker.herokuapp.com/.

### Context

The Covid-19 global pandemic had a major impact on several public services in France, particularly hospitals. Multiple Covid-19 dashboards were created, but none of them showed the situation of hospitals during the influx of patients. Many hospitals faced saturation of beds and medical staff due to the large number of hospitalizations and intensive care required. The Covid-19 hospital tracker is a dashboard built to visualize in particular the situation of **hospitals** in each department of France.

### Objective

Our main goal is to add interactivity and focus on the hospital situation around the covid-19 pandemic. Hence, our target users are any person willing to have information concerning the state of hospitals.
